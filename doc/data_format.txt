The generic specification for messages is:

UDP
host order (intel byte ordering)
floats (intel IEEE...) <- Challenge in Java, MS .net has utilities to
do this for you.

The ip addresses and ports are identified and configurable in the text
files included with the executable. Please look there.

There are two specific messages you need to know about.

Sensor feedback from Dynamics Engine to LabVIEW (your JAVA):
100 Hz (or current I/O timestep value)
10 floats

(1) timestamp (any monotonic increasing float to act as a filter for
UDP packets on imperfect networks)
(2) Left wheel angle (radians... 3 inch radius)
(3) Right wheel angle (radians... 3 inch radius)
(4) Arm angle (radians... zero radians is straight out and positive
values are down).
(5) Wrist angle (radians... zero radians is straight out and positive
values are down).
(6) Left wheel speed (radians / sec... 3 inch radius)
(7) Right wheel speed (radians / sec... 3 inch radius)
(8) Arm speed (radians / sec).
(9) Wrist speed (radians / sec).
(10) Heading Rate (rad / sec... right hand rule about robot local z-up axis)


Actuator applied loads from LabVIEW (your JAVA) to Dynamics Engine:

You can post updates at any rate you wish. The dynamics runs faster
than real-time at 3 kHz, and pauses for the socket interactions at 100
Hz (or the prescribed I/O timestep value, in which it will process
everything at once and applies only the newest value).

6 floats.

(1) timestamp (same idea as sensor message, but numerical values need
not be related)
(2) Left "track" torque (in lbs)
(3) Right "track" torque (in lbs)
(4) Arm torque (in lbs)
(5) Wrist torque (in lbs)
(6) Grip state (0.0 = nothing, 1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0 = various game pieces)
