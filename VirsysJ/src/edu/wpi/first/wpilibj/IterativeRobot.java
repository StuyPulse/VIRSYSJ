/**
 * IterativeRobot implements a specific type of Robot Program framework, extending the RobotBase class.
 *
 * The IterativeRobot class is intended to be subclassed by a user creating a robot program.
 *
 * This class is intended to implement the "old style" default code, by providing
 * the following functions which are called by the main loop, startCompetition(), at the appropriate times:
 *
 * robotInit() -- provide for initialization at robot power-on
 *
 * init() functions -- each of the following functions is called once when the
 *                     appropriate mode is entered:
 *  - DisabledInit()   -- called only when first disabled
 *  - AutonomousInit() -- called each and every time autonomous is entered from another mode
 *  - TeleopInit()     -- called each and every time teleop is entered from another mode
 *
 * Periodic() functions -- each of these functions is called iteratively at the
 *                         appropriate periodic rate (aka the "slow loop").  The period of
 *                         the iterative robot is synced to the driver station control packets,
 *                         giving a periodic frequency of about 50Hz (50 times per second).
 *   - disabledPeriodic()
 *   - autonomousPeriodic()
 *   - teleopPeriodic()
 *
 * Continuous() functions -- each of these functions is called repeatedly as
 *                           fast as possible:
 *   - disabledContinuous()
 *   - autonomousContinuous()
 *   - teleopContinuous()
 *
